The Jupyter notebook is a simple values_count analysis of four questions that were part of France's Grand DÃ©bat in early 2019.
It identifies the answers that occure frequently because they were stock answers supplied by groups interested in promoting 
particular issues.

The csv file is a simple count of how many answers were traced back to which groups.
